        <p>I enjoy coding websites and playing the Viola as well. I find passion in playing video games as well as making art. I am currently learning about Flask and Python and how to make websites with it. I made this website as one of the projects for a course I am taking. I hope that you enjoy this website, which represents the work that I can make with my skills. If you would like to suggest any edits, please click on the suggest edit button on the navigation bar. If you suggest a good comment, you will help me make my site a lot better! Also please note that I used a template for some of the styling of website. However, all the functionality of the website is completely what I made with help from my course. You can also view all the blog posts that I create. In the future I plan to add new features to this site and make it better and better. The more I code the better I will get. I am still learning how to code, so if you face a problem making sure to go to the suggest edit page to let me know. I will try to keep track of the edits suggested there. Thanks for visiting! I hope you enjoy your time on my website. I am so glad that you get to see what I made. Thank you!</p>
